      Hello, {{ profile.fb_name }}. You're a {{ profile.preferred_candidate }} voter in {{ profile.state }}, a {{ profile_context.state_type }}.

        Voting for {{ profile.preferred_candidate }} in {{ profile.state }} is
        extremely dangerous.  You'll take votes away from Hillary Clinton and let
        Trump win the presidency.
      {% endif %}
      You should swap your vote with

      VoteSwap can only connect you to your Facebook friends and
      friends-of-friends, but not enough of your friends have signed up
      for us to find a great match for you.

    <p>
      Since you live in a {{ profile_context.state_type }}, your best strategy
      is to <b>share VoteSwap with your friends in {{ profile_context.paired_state_type }} states</b>.
      Sharing VoteSwap on Facebook will reach the most people, but sending
      direct messages to your friends in {{ profile_context.paired_state_type }} 
      states is probably more effective. Here are suggested messages to send:
    </p>
    <p>
      To your friends in safe states:
      {% if profile_context.is_3p_in_swing %}
        <blockquote>
          I want to vote for a third party in {{ profile.state }}, but I also
          don't want Trump to win. You should join
          <a href="https://voteswap.us">https://voteswap.us</a> and swap votes
          with me. I'll vote Clinton in {{ profile.state }} if you vote
          {{ profile.preferred_candidate }} in your state.
        </blockquote>
      {% else %}
        <blockquote>
          Do you want to prevent Trump from winning but also think third
          parties should be a viable choice? Join
          <a href="https://voteswap.us">https://voteswap.us</a> and swap your
          Clinton vote in your safe state with a third-party voter in a swing
          state. Third parties will get more votes, and Clinton will win the
          important swing states so Trump will lose.
        </blockquote>
      {% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      To your friends in swing states:
        <blockquote>
          You live in an important swing state, where voting for a third party
          might split the vote and make Trump win (remember Al Gore?).
          The best way for third parties to get representation without electing
          Trump is to join <a href="https://voteswap.us">https://voteswap.us</a>
          and help connect third-party voters with Clinton voters in safe
          states. VoteSwap pairs up swing-state and safe-state voters so they
          can swap votes. Clinton will win the swing states, third parties get
          more votes (and more federal funding), and Trump loses. Even if
          you're already voting for Clinton, the more people that join the
          better our chances are of pairing up voters and saving our country
          from Trump.
