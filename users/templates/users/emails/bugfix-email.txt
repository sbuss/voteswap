Urgent bugfix!
==============

Have you been frustrated that nobody is responding to your swap proposals?
Well, it turns out that swapping with random users was a little broken. I
received a few reports of swaps failing, and it turns out that trying to swap
with a random user hit an untested corner case in my code, so it was failing. I
have fixed this bug (and added more tests), but you all need to go back to 
https://voteswap.us and try to swap again. It'll work this time!

I feel pretty awful that this was failing silently, but there's still plenty of
time to swap your vote before election day!

Only 2 days until the election!
===============================

We're only two days away from election day! Membership of voteswap keeps
growing, so if we can all swap we can help keep Trump out of the White House.
If you haven't already, please enable swapping with random users to increase
the chances of finding a swap before Tuesday by going to
https://voteswap.us{% url 'users:update_profile' %} and clicking the
"OK to match me with people I don't know" checkbox.

Don't forget to share voteswap with your friends on facebook via
https://voteswap.us{% url 'users:share' %}
Clinton can still lose the election, and every vote helps!
