Facebook Message Problems
=========================

I've gotten a few reports of people not responding to facebook messages. It
turns out that Facebook is silently hiding messages when you send a message
to someone you're not friends with. You can view these hidden messages by
viewing your "message requests" at https://www.facebook.com/messages/pending

If your match isn't responding to your facebook message, please add them as
a friend on facebook and try again! You can find a link to their profile by
clicking on their name when viewing your potential matches.

TrumpTraders.org
================

If your matches aren't responding late into the night, you should check out
https://trumptraders.org They have several thousand users and you might have
better luck there.

The election is tomorrow!
=========================

I can't wait for this whole thing to be over. Please don't forget to vote.
If you don't know where your polling place is, just google "where do I vote"
and it'll locate it for you.

After the election
==================

I'll send one follow-up email after the election asking if you want me to keep
your email. The default will be that I will delete all user accounts within
30 days after the election. You won't keep getting spam from me :)
