Only 19 days until the election!

Thanks for signing up for voteswap! We're only 19 days away from the election
and, unfortunately, we're a little short on users. It looks like the original
plan to only connect people with friends and friends-of-friends isn't going to
work, so we've added an option to match people with random users.

We respect your privacy, so this option is disabled by default. If you would
like to swap with a random user, please go to https://voteswap.us{% url 'users:update_profile' %}
and click the "OK to match me with people I don't know" checkbox.

Only 40 people have signed up so far, so be sure to share voteswap with your
friends while you're there! Clinton can still lose the election, and every vote
helps!
