      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
      When you join Vote Swap, you'll be matched with a friend in your Facebook
      network. Friends in swing states that want to vote Stein or Johnson will
      swap votes with friends in safe states that want to vote Clinton. This
      lets third parties get votes without giving away the presidency to Trump.
      </p>
      <h3 id="legal">Is this legal?</h3>
      <p>
      Yes! In <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/08/06/0655517.pdf">Porter v Bowen (2007)</a>,
      vote swapping websites were ruled legal, at least in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit">9th circuit</a>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        On the merits, we hold that [California] violated Appellants’ First
        Amendment rights. The websites’ vote-swapping mechanisms as well as the
        communication and vote swaps they enabled were constitutionally
        protected.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      For more background, please read "<a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2891">The Ninth Circuit ruled that vote-swapping is legal. Let’s use it to stop Trump</a>" by Scott Aaronson, or <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/archives/009038.html">electionlawblog.org's coverage of the ruling</a>.
      <h3>Let's not screw this up</h3>
      <p>
      George W. Bush won the 2000 election by winning Florida by 537 votes.
      If just a small fraction of the 97,421 Ralph Nader voters in Florida
      had vote swapped, Al Gore would have won.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is the most important election in decades. We can either let a
      bigoted, racist, xenophobic, unstable little dictator destroy our
      country. Or we can come together and elect someone with decades of
      experience in domestic and foreign policy, who listens to advice and has
      a calm, clear head. She may not be your favorite candidate, but she won't
      screw up the country. So do your part and don't screw it up either.
